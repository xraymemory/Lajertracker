# Lajertracker - the writing is on the wall

Lajertracker is a neat application that lets you write on walls using a laser pointer, a webcam, and a projector using Quil, a Clojure wrapper for the Processing API. Lajertracker utilizes image homography to track laser points along a wall, resulting in a fluid, brush-like motion.
